						<h4>Useful is forever</h4>
						<p>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don’t.</p>

					<div id="big_number">3</div>
					<div id="text">
						<h4>Clarity is king</h4>
						<p>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.</p>

				<div id="principle_box">
					<div id="big_number">4</div>
					<div id="text">
						<h4>Our customers are our investor</h4>
						<p>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them — not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.</p>

					<div id="big_number">7</div>
					<div id="text">
						<h4>Software should be easy</h4>
						<p>Our products are intuitive. You’ll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don’t sell you training because you don’t need it.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			
				<div id="principle_box">
					<div id="big_number">8</div>
					<div id="text">
						<h4>Long-term contracts are obscene</h4>
						<p>No one likes being locked into something they don’t want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.</p>
