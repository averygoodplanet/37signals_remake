37signals_remake
================

Thinkful.com educational project to recreate the static look and some jQuery effects of the 37signals homepage.

--There are a few differences in exact sizing and exact formatting of text between my remake and the original page. I'm settling for the formatting I've arrived at, choosing to move on to working on jQuery effects on the page. 

jQuery effects:

-Day of Week. Upper-left hand corner of the webpage displays today's day of the week, e.g. "Happy Saturday." 

-Hovering over .box divs, changes the headline displayed in the center of the top of the page. 

-Substitute color photo over bw photo above "Meet our customers". I was unable to precisely crop the images of bw and color photos to precisely overlay, creating the problem of the image appearing to move when substituted; emailed someone to ask if there is a better way to crop the images to overlay perfectly.
